# Spatial Classification of Crops Using K-Nearest Neighbors

This is a model I've put together to demonstrate KNN at a low-level using Minecraft as a reference point. Not a novel discovery nor something all too impressive, just a tool for a bigger project I'm working on ðŸ™‚!

The model takes data.csv, which holds information about pumpkins and melons and where they're commonly found in reference to their respective biomes' attributes.
